{ STEP 1: Replace <FORMULA1> through <FORMULA4> with the formulas you wish to plot.  
  Note that Value1 through Value4 are numeric variables, temporary holding places for 
  the results of your numeric formulas.  To assign non-generic names to your plots, you 
  may replace "Plot1" through "Plot4"  (leaving the quotes) with names you choose.  The 
  specified names will appear in the chart analysis data window. }
inputs: 
	Price( Close ),
	FastLength( 7 ),
	SlowLength( 14 ),
	TLLength( 4 ), 
	ColorVal( Red ), 
	ColorBase( Darkgreen ), 	
	Displace( 0 ) ;

{ OPTIONAL STEPS: To specify alert criteria that will sound an audible alert when 
  triggered, replace FALSE with your criteria.  To specify a brief alert description 
  that will be included in the alert notification pop-up window, insert your 
  description between the quotes ( "" ).  Note that Condition1 is a logical variable, a 
  temporary holding place for the true-false result of the criteria. }
